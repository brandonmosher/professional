Pending
- Write template/% rule in Makefile to allow automated builds using LaTex Workshop
- Report warnings when keys exist in JSON that have no matching environment or macro in the tex template and vice-versa
 - Consider adding --tex-template-dirpath and --data-dirpath command-line options to limit the need for relative/absolute paths in .version files.
- Consider implementing more fine-grained control over JSON merge for arrays including the ability to merge objects in an with matching "id", and to specify "order". Perhaps a 'merge_behavior' property that specifies 'insert_before' or 'insert_after'.
- make "value" property work transparently (i.e. empty \p{} tag will work) for objects in lists. Or just use "value: everywhere"
- Update README section.
    - Add section for new tag JSON format.
    - Add discussion on keeping a private repo for data and using tags to produce "redacted" versions of professional documents.
    - json merge and sort property names
    - no-prune-property-names
    - strategies for overwrite, omit, merge

- input python files that generate JSON dynamically. e.g. achieve skills grouped by proficiency in one setting and skills by category in another.

Complete
- Removed unused properties from JSON in build
- rename degrees to separatedItems
- update header social entries to use separated items environment
- update README
- Consider reverting to previous filtering mechanism to create different document versions using tags. Allow tags to be specified via command line.
- update setup.cfg, .devcontainer, and Dockerfile to handle dependencies for python and json_to_text package
- make public
- use json data to generate vertical timeline on website
- JSON for coverletter
- json_to_tex
    - command line args for template and json filenames
    - ability to specify multiple json files to be merged allowing global defaults across multiple docs
