\lettersection{About Me}
{\begin{clparagraphs}
\begin{clparagraph}
I am a former U.S. Navy Cryptologic Technician Chief Petty Officer turned software engineer and physicist. I have over a decade of experience leading teams, conducting intelligence analysis, troubleshooting complex software systems, and coding solutions in high-pressure operational environments. My technical skills, which include computer architecture, embedded systems, server infrastructure, APIs, user interfaces, data analytics, and DevOps, span the entire stack.

\lettersection{Why Me}
{\begin{clparagraphs}
\begin{clparagraph}
I care deeply about writing performant, secure, maintainable, and elegant code across the entire stack. During my recent overseas deployment, I built Python packages and Jupyter Notebooks to automate, with high fault tolerance and rigorous legal safeguards, labor-intensive data analytics. My work resulted in 99\% up-time and 50\% increased throughput. Additionally, I built a full-stack web application to plan and visualize resource allocation over time, resulting in zero coverage gaps during my tenure. These tools contributed directly to the safety of deployed U.S. forces and the achievement of tactical and strategic objectives.
\end{clparagraph}
\begin{clparagraph}
I am well organized, detail-oriented, and able to effectively prioritize conflicting demands in a fast-paced work environment. I have strong analytical, research, and time-management skills, and a very high degree of commitment to my work.
\end{clparagraph}
\begin{clparagraph}
I would be delighted to leverage my experience as a software engineer at your company. Thank you for taking the time to review my resume. I am available for an interview at your convenience.
