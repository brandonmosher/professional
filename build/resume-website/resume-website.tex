{\begin{cvparagraph}
My personal resume adapted from posquit0's Awesome-CV. The json\_to\_tex Python package generates tex documents from arbitrary JSON data and a tex template with matching hierarchical structure and value placeholder macros. Tailored document versions can be generated using tags or an ordered set of JSON mixins. Build infrastructure keeps source, includes, and artifacts separate. Dockerfile and Visual Studio Code configuration included for a no-hassle tex environment.
